### If you get an error "Sorry something went wrong. Reload?"  
Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

- Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
- Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/PeachDo/3-1androidtermproject/blob/master/Keras/keras_test.ipynb") there and then you get "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/PeachDo/3-1androidtermproject/blob/master/Keras/keras_test.ipynb"  
>This site nbviewer works independently of github.
